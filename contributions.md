Everyone, from undergraduate students to senior researchers, who is interested in developmental research is welcome! You can contribute by:

1. *Planning and writing*: All steps and procedures, from literature review to data analyses, are defined in collaboration before the start of data collection (leading to [pre-registrations](https://www.cos.io/prereg) and/or [registered-reports](https://www.cos.io/rr)).
2. *Creating methods, materials, and analyses*: Adaptation and/or creation of methods, materials, and analyses are usually necessary (e.g., [MB-AtHome]({{site.baseurl}}/MB-athome/)).
3. *Collecting data*: Data is collected following standard research protocols, which can often require adaptation of labs' routines and staff training.

[Authorship]({{site.baseurl}}/authorship/) is granted to anyone who had a sustained intellectual contribution on any of these tasks. [Join the team today]({{site.baseurl}}/get_involved/) and/or get in touch with the [Governing Board](mailto:manybabies-gb@mailman.stanford.edu) to learn more.

## New Projects

If you are interested in leading a new [**ManyBabies** project]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/) (either a main project or a spin-off that would involve data collection across multiple labs), please complete the [project proposal form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kbnK2us2Svfcf7X4TAI5YUw3_duUNAQoYINTuuWr1Jw/edit) and/or contact the **MB** [Governing Board](mailto:manybabies-gb@mailman.stanford.edu).
