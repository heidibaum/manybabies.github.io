The [MB Dashboard](https://manybabies.shinyapps.io/shiny_mb_map/) displays the geographical distribution of MB collaborators. It is a powerful tool for communicating with researchers and the general public, as it quickly and intuitively shows MB diversity and reach.

To be added to the MB Dashboard, please **fill out the form below**.

To update any Dashboard information (*e.g., change of affiliation, name*), you can either fill out the form below or [email us](mailto:manybabiesconsortium@gmail.com).

If you are a project leader and want to add multiple collaborators at once, please [email us](mailto:manybabiesconsortium@gmail.com).

All responses are **moderated** before being added to the dashboard. This may take some time, we appreciate your patience.
