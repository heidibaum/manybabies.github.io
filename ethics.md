## ManyBabies Ethics Guidance

All research labs collecting data for a ManyBabies project are required to obtain ethics approval from their local ethics review boards. For researchers from a laboratory without a local ethics review board, we provide some baseline ethics guidance in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR2nv4Wy1soDS4cBBNy9QZOyewvvjP1ka1reBRhAIzcrNi0reJxgHuhGS7f7i2wE0ScQuppek8Al_21/pub). For additional questions about ethics issues, please contact the Project Leads or [contact@manybabies.org](mailto:contact@manybabies.org).

## ManyBabies Ethics Protocol Library

We are often asked by labs new to ManyBabies to provide examples of ethics protocols to help them get started with their own ethics applications. We know that ethics requirements vary by country, region, and institution, so we are curating a "library" of ethics protocols to help reduce the burden on researchers hoping to participate in our studies (or to run studies in their own labs!).   

> Note: Protocols are listed in order of submission. You can filter, group, and/or sort entries by any field(s).

## MB Ethis Protocol Contribution Form

Help us promote open and diverse developmental science by sharing your ethics protocols and application materials using this **quick and easy [contribution form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf2gZ4_3Ft4odvTxeHjZLe5ak2ZqW8H55l5jjWZgS8FKFuRPA/viewform?usp=sf_link)**. 

> NOTE: We welcome protocols for ANY developmental study testing children ages 0-3. This includes non-ManyBabies studies! 
> Form responses are moderated, so your response will not display fully at first (don't worry!).
