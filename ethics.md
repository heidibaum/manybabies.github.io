## ManyBabies Ethics Guidance

All research labs collecting data for a ManyBabies project are required to obtain ethics approval from their local ethics review board. For researchers from a laboratory without a local ethics review board, we provide some baseline ethics guidance in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR2nv4Wy1soDS4cBBNy9QZOyewvvjP1ka1reBRhAIzcrNi0reJxgHuhGS7f7i2wE0ScQuppek8Al_21/pub" target="_blank">this document</a>. For additional questions about ethics issues, please ask Project Leads or email us at [contact@manybabies.org](mailto:contact@manybabies.org).

## ManyBabies Ethics Protocol Library

We are often asked by labs new to ManyBabies to provide examples of ethics protocols to help them get started with their own ethics applications. We know that ethics requirements vary by country, region, and institution, so we are curating a "library" of ethics protocols to help reduce the burden on researchers hoping to participate in our studies (or to run studies in their own labs!).   

> Note: Protocols are listed in order of submission. You can filter, group, and/or sort entries by any field(s).
