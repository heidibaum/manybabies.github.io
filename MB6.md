We are excited to launch our newest ManyBabies experimental project, **MB6: Neonatal Imitation**! 

We hosted a pair of planning workshops in July 2022 to hear from experts about their own research and ideas for the project, and to initiate discussions about what a "best test" of neontatal imitation would look like. Subscribe to the listserv (link below) for future updates!

Please contact MB Executive Director, [Heidi Baumgartner](mailto:heidib@stanford.edu), with questions.
