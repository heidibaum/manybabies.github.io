Our newest ManyBabies experimental project, MB6, is on Neonatal Imitation! 

[View the recording of our first planning session](https://stanford.zoom.us/rec/share/Gsyuh5B-PnpwWt-6_8ZtMXsLcv8UNn6FPLvsbZqPbQm8X5VWsEDDPHefTPzs5MLs.lFTjsqVJJ-wN8sxJ?startTime=1657663437000), held on July 12/13 2022, in which experts presented their own findings in the field and began to discuss what a "best test" of neonatal imitation would look like. 

Join us for a second planning workshop on July 28 to hear from more experts and be part of the discussion. [Register Here!](https://stanford.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_G1K7usoARpiEdTov0X1KaQ)
