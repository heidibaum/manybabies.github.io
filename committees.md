**ManyBabies Committees** are working groups dedicated to brainstorming and implementing ideas on a specific topic for the benefit of the MB community. Our committees are a great way to contribute to the overarching goals of ManyBabies and network with MB colleagues via a minimal time commitment.


#### Who can join? 
Anyone! We especially encourage students, Early Career Researchers (including students) and researchers from outside of US/Canada/Western Europe to get involved.

#### How to join?
