In this ongoing project we aim to investigate the test-retest reliability of the methods that have been used to investigate abstract rule learning in infancy during ManyBabies3. Therefore, participating labs will test babies twice within a certain time interval. Additionally, we are interested in questions regarding the robustness of reliability estimates across different methods (head-turn preference procedure, central fixation, or eye tracking) and over development.
