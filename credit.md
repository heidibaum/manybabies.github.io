title: CRediT Reporting

***
All MB Contributors are asked to report project contributions using the **MB Contribution Reporting Form** (below). ManyBabies uses the [**Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT)**](https://credit.niso.org/) to transparently track and report each contributor's specific contribution(s). 

#### To update your contributions for a project, fill out the form again (newer responses will replace older responses).
