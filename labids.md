***
One of the most important things for keeping track of all the different participating labs in ManyBabies projects is having a unique and consistent identifier for each lab, which we call a **LabID**.

We ask labs to use this identifier in the name of every data file that they submit so that we can track and automatically analyze all submitted data. If your lab is collecting data for more than one project, please use the same LabID for all projects.
