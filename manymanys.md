## About
ManyManys is a large-scale collaboration on comparative cognition and behavior across taxa. This project grew out of discussions between members of many Big Team Science groups, including ManyBabies. The group came together at a hackathon during the [2022 Big Team Science Conference](https://bigteamscienceconference.github.io/) to brainstorm ideas for a project that would harness the power of our individual networks.
