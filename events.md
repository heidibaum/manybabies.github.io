### *Past*

## Open data for developmental science
### Christina Bergmann, *Osnabrück University of Applied Sciences & Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics*
#### May 11, 2023 8:30-10:00am CEST (Berlin, Germany; UTC +2) on Zoom

Open data is one of the key mandates in calls for increased transparency, with badges, citation advantages, and sometimes even refusal to publish papers when data are not made open. For developmental researchers, this need for transparency stands in stark contrast with confidentiality, especially when working with infants. Christina reviews developmental science's impressive history of open data to show that there are ways to ethically and responsibly share data, and then discusses different strategies and emerging best practices to balance participant protection with transparency.

## ManyBabies: An Introduction to Open Science
### Nicolás Alessandroni & Krista Byers-Heinlein, *Concordia University*
#### October 20, 2022 11:00-12:30 EDT (Montréal, Canada) on Zoom

### [VIEW THE WEBINAR RECORDING](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUQjJSLLL-M)
#### Slides available on [OSF](https://osf.io/5x8yk/)

In this workshop, Nicolás and Krista introduce the open science perspective for psychological research. The aim is for participants to discover, discuss, and engage in using open science practices (e.g., open access, open data, preprints, pre-registration) and to learn ways to apply them in their own research. The workshop does not require prior knowledge of open science; all those interested in learning or deepening their knowledge of how to do open research are most welcome!
