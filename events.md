#### June 4 & 6, 2024
### ManyBabies Town Halls

<p>The main goal of these Town Halls was to discuss ManyBabies from a broad perspective: Where should ManyBabies go next in terms of individual projects as well as overall directions? How should our network of developmental scientists evolve to help make the field better?</p>

<p><i>If you were unable to attend either Town Hall, we would still love to hear your ideas. Please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdAsflB7grZQtW3t9SahoWP7kpTsNDmrZKt0_s1E80I9mzRKQ/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">fill out this form</a> to share your thoughts with us!</i></p>

### Behavioral Coding Software for Developmental Science:
### An overview of BORIS, Datavyu, and ELAN

Behavioral coding software streamlines the process of analyzing infant behavior by providing tools to record, categorize, and measure observational data. It allows researchers to precisely capture and quantify complex behaviors, thus enabling deeper insights into infant development. In this 90-minute webinar hosted by Nicolás Alessandroni and Brianna McMillan, we hear from representatives of <a href="https://www.boris.unito.it/" target="_blank">BORIS</a>, <a href="https://datavyu.org/" target="_blank">Datavyu</a>, and <a href="https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan" target="_blank">ELAN</a>, who showcase each software’s main features and possibilities. Following the presentations, there is a Q&A and discussion on potential applications in infant research. Take advantage of this chance to discover how these tools can enhance your research!

**Thank you to Marco Gamba from BORIS, Kasey Soska from Databrary, and Divya Kanekal & Han Sloetjes from ELAN for participating!**

### Power Analysis workshop
#### Christopher Cox, *Aarhus University*

Presenter Christopher M. M. Cox (Aarhus University) leads an interactive workshop on power analysis. The workshop includes both theoretical and practical components. In the theoretical component, he discusses why to conduct power analyses, how to incorporate information from previous studies, and why we should construe power analyses as useful opportunities to think through the design dynamics of a study.

The practical component includes an R tutorial on how to conduct simulation-based power analyses for linear mixed-effects models (and possible extensions to GLMMS). To gain practical experience in how to simulate data and run power analyses, you can work through the provided tutorial using an up-to-date R version (4 or above) and RStudio (version 1.3 or above). If you do not have experience with R, you can still get a lot out of the workshop and will be able to follow along, as all code and code output are available at the link below.

### Open data for developmental science
#### Christina Bergmann, *Osnabrück University of Applied Sciences & Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics*

Open data is one of the key mandates in calls for increased transparency, with badges, citation advantages, and sometimes even refusal to publish papers when data are not made open. For developmental researchers, this need for transparency stands in stark contrast with confidentiality, especially when working with infants. Christina reviews developmental science's impressive history of open data to show that there are ways to ethically and responsibly share data, and then discusses different strategies and emerging best practices to balance participant protection with transparency.

### ManyBabies: An Introduction to Open Science
#### Nicolás Alessandroni & Krista Byers-Heinlein, *Concordia University*

In this workshop, Nicolás and Krista introduce the open science perspective for psychological research. The aim is for participants to discover, discuss, and engage in using open science practices (e.g., open access, open data, preprints, pre-registration) and to learn ways to apply them in their own research. The workshop does not require prior knowledge of open science; all those interested in learning or deepening their knowledge of how to do open research are most welcome!
