In this ongoing project we investigate a fundamental aspect of human nature: evaluating others’ actions as praiseworthy or blameworthy. <img style="float: right;" src="/assets/img/mb4_site_300px.png"> We do so in a closely coordinated, multi-laboratory, standardized study aimed at replicating the helping/hindering finding reported by ([Hamlin, Wynn, & Bloom, 2007](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06288)). Using a video-taped version of the original [puppet show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anCaGBsBOxM), labs from around the world will collect data from infants between the ages of 5.5 and 10.5 months.

### Leads
