## Project Overview

* *Status: **We are currently collecting data and piloting coding protocols/software** to code infants’ emotional responses and posture. If you have any ideas or suggestions, please do not hesitate to reach out to us and join as a collaborator!*

The goal of this project is to measure infants’ emotional responses (e.g. positive/negative affect) to the helping/hindering events in [**MB4**]({{site.baseurl}}/MB4/). We aim to understand the relation between infants' affect and social preferences (e.g. similar to <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjdp.12232" target="_blank">Steckler et al., 2017</a>). We plan to analyze infants' facial expressions (e.g., positive/negative affect) and other observable responses (e.g., posture, following <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00858/full" target="_blank">Hepach et al., 2015</a> while viewing the MB4 habituation videos. In addition to theoretical contributions, we aim to identify new methodological tools that can be used at scale to store, share, and analyze infant video data. We also seek to explore and validate innovative and scalable ways to code variables that previously relied solely on human coding (e.g., facial expression and posture).
