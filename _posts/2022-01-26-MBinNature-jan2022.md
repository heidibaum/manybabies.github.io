We are thrilled to share this [commentary in <I>Nature</I>](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00150-2), highlighting the promise of (and challenges for) organizations like ManyBabies! 

ManyBabies Governing Board member and MB4 Project Lead Kiley Hamlin co-authored the piece with representatives from other big team science organizations [Psychological Science Accelerator](https://psysciacc.org), [ManyPrimates](https://manyprimates.github.io), and [DRAGNet](https://dragnetglobal.weebly.com/). 

This commentary grew out a roundtable discussion about Big Team Science at the 2021 Metascience Conference ([view the discussion here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnvNA-zycA)).
