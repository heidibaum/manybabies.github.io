Out now in <i>Royal Society Open Science</i>, a new article about ["The puzzling relationship between multi-laboratory replications and meta-analyses of the published literature"](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.211499). 

ManyBabies member Michael Frank co-authored the paper examining possible sources of the discrepancy between effect size estimates derived from meta-analyses and multi-lab replications of the same phenomena.
