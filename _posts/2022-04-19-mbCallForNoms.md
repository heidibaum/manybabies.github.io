## ManyBabies is expanding our leadership! 

ManyBabies projects are centrally coordinated by the Governing Board and the Executive Director (more info [here]({{site.baseurl}}/about/)). In order to increase the perspectives involved in MB leadership, we are expanding the Governing Board from seven to nine members, and we are adding the role of Student Advisor. 

We are hereby calling for nominations for individuals to join ManyBabies general leadership 1) as a **Governing Board (GB) member** or 2) in the newly created role of **Student Advisor (SA)**.

Individuals may nominate themselves or others as candidates for the GB and/or SA positions by [emailing us](mailto:manybabiesconsortium@gmail.com) by May 11, 2022. 

More information about the roles, the nomination process, and the election/selection process can be found [here](https://mailchi.mp/7eb70bcff3b5/mb-callfornominations).
