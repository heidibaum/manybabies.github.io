The [May issue](https://mailchi.mp/9d59dfc5cd41/mb-newsletter-may-2022?e=121b29a6d4) of the ManyBabies newsletter is out! 

In this issue you'll find a reminder to vote in our election to select two new members of the Governing Board, info about upcoming events (including our now-monthly Office Hours), and project updates.

If you're subscribed to an MB listserv, you should have received the newsletter in your inbox (please [email us](mailto:manybabiesconsortium@gmail.com) if that's not the case). To subscribe for future issues, click [here](https://t.co/7zxifYO7qN?amp=1).
