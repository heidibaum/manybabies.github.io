## Student Advisor nominations 

Our inaugural SAs will be completing their term in June and we are issuing a call for nominations for their successor(s). 

The role of Student Advisor (SA) was created to ensure that the student perspective is fully considered in ManyBabies’ organizational decision making. ‘Student’ here is defined as anyone not yet having completed their PhD or a comparable degree (acknowledging that doctoral candidates may not be considered students everywhere).

The primary responsibility of the MB Student Advisor is to attend monthly 1-hour Governing Board meetings and participate in leadership discussions to ensure the student perspective is represented. In addition, the SA will have the opportunity to be involved with other leadership roles, such as sitting on specialized ManyBabies committees.

The one year term is non-renewable, although SAs might be invited to continue on in another capacity.

Individuals may nominate themselves or others as candidates for the GB and/or SA positions by [emailing us](mailto:manybabies@manybabies.org) by May 31, 2023. 

More information about the role, the nomination process, and SA selection can be found [here]({{site.baseurl}}/newsletters/2023-studentadvisorcall).
