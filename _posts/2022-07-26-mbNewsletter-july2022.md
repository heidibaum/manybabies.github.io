Check out the [July issue](https://mailchi.mp/b1bcc29c8f08/mb-newsletter-july2022) of the ManyBabies newsletter! 

There's information about registering for the second [MB6]({{site.baseurl}}/MB6/) planning workshop and submitting to the [Big Team Science Conference](https://bigteamscienceconference.github.io), as well as project updates. Big news: MB3's [Stage 1 Registered Report](https://psyarxiv.com/aex7v/) was given an 'In Principle Acceptance' by *Developmental Science*. MB2, MB3, and MB4 are all preparing to begin data collection soon. 

If you're subscribed to an MB listserv, you should have received the newsletter in your inbox (please [email us](mailto:manybabiesconsortium@gmail.com) if that's not the case). To subscribe for future issues, click [here](https://t.co/7zxifYO7qN?amp=1).
