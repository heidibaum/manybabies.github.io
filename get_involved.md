* <h4>Email Project Leads</h4>
  * If you know which project you are interested in joining, you can **email one or more of the Project Leads directly** to ask how to get involved. Contact info for all Project Leads is available [**here**]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/).
* <h4>Come to Drop-In Hours</h4>
  * You are welcome to join us at our **monthly "Drop-in Hours"** (currently held on the first Thursday of each month) to talk with us about contribution opportunities. Times and links to join via Zoom can be found in our [**calendar**]({{site.baseurl}}/calendar/).
