In this ongoing project we aim to investigate the relationship between infants' rule learning abilities and their later developing language acquisition skills in a longitudinal design. Therefore, participating labs assess language abilities at 18, 24 and 30 months of age using the CDI as well as language recordings in a naturalistic and a semi-structured setting. We are interested in the questions to what extent rule learning abilities predict later grammar skills, if this relationship changes with age; and if certain characteristics of the first language the infants are exposed to (e.g., like complexity) lead to any systematic differences in the strength of this relationship.
