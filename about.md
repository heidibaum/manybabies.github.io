The **ManyBabies** project was [born](https://babieslearninglanguage.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-manybabies-project.html) committed to Open Science and to collaborative research practices that allow teams to test hypotheses about infant development that individual labs could perhaps never adequately test. <br>

**MB's** collaborative nature implies that all project decisions (e.g., research question, study design, stimulus creation, piloting, data collection, analysis, interpretation of the findings, and writing) are made on a consensus-based approach. <br>

We strive for an environment of trust and equality that can engage researchers from a broad spectrum of backgrounds. To learn more about **MB's** vision for the role of large-scale collaborations, see [Frank et al. (2017)](https://psyarxiv.com/27b43/) and [Byers-Heinlein et al. (2020)](https://psyarxiv.com/dmhk2/).

<!-- Too detailed?
Infant research usually requires significant human and financial resources and is slow to conduct. These aspects, combined with the pressure to publish at a rapid pace to secure promotions and funding, can render the conduction of large-scale projects unpractical under individual labs contexts.

Too historical?
On the other hand, large-scale *collaborative* and *Open Science* projects have the potential to test complex hypothesis and avoid the consequences of low statistical power [(Button et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn3475) and the dramatic inflation of false positives caused by “questionable research practices” [(Simmons, Nelson, & Simonsohn, 2011)](https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797611417632). Inspired by [Klein et al. (2014)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1027/1864-9335/a000178) ManyLabs' first study, in which a group of independent labs all ran the same set of replication protocols and pooled their data, an e-mail thread began, which eventually led to a [blog post](https://babieslearninglanguage.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-manybabies-project.html), and to the formation of the consortium of infancy labs.

## Code of Conduct
See **MB's** [Code of Conduct]({{site.baseurl}}/code_conduct/) for a full description of our pledge, standards, responsibilities, and scope.

***

## Definitions and Roles

### **ManyBabies** activities are guided by the principles of:
* <b><i>Transparency</i></b>: All decisions in a **MB** project, from design to publication, are as transparent as possible
* <b><i>Collective governance</i></b>: When possible and feasible, decisions are made jointly and transparently
* <b><i>Inclusivity and diversity</i></b>: **MB** explicitly encourages efforts to increase diversity. This includes active applications for funding to assist laboratories from under-represented communities to participate, outreach efforts, and planning workshops
* <b><i>Ethical research</i></b>: **MB** projects are committed to best practices and high ethical standards
* <b><i>Respect</i></b>: Everyone agrees to a general code of conduct which ensures respectful interactions


### **ManyBabies** [projects]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/) aim to test hypotheses about:
* <b><i>Validity</i></b>: Assess the replicability, generalizability, and robustness of key findings in infancy (effect + effect size + moderators) in consensus paradigms. Note that these paradigms are not necessarily exact replications of seminal studies
* <b><i>Theory</i></b>: Understand infant development across a wide range of ages and experiences (e.g., language and cultural background)
* <b><i>Methods</i></b>: Quantify sources of variability across labs and establish best practices
* <b><i>Diversity</i></b>: Increase diversity of participants, researchers, & research questions

### **ManyBabies** collaborators come from [40+ nations on 6 continents](https://manybabies.shinyapps.io/shiny_mb_map/). They can serve as:
* <b><i>Governing Board Members</i></b>: Responsible for governance decisions, including decisions about funding, new projects, and other project-wide concerns (see current members [here]({{site.baseurl}}/people/))
* <b><i>Project Leads</i></b>: Coordinate all aspects of a study (e.g., setting up work groups, guidelines) and ensure that all aspects adhere to the **MB** [Code of Conduct]({{site.baseurl}}/code_conduct/) (see current Project Leads [here]({{site.baseurl}}/get_involved/))
* <b><i>Data Contributors</i></b>: Collect data following an experimental protocol 
* <b><i>Project Contributors</i></b>: Create stimuli, protocols, analysis code, and any other relevant tasks
